Work on this more so it can easily look better than this!

#### Implementations
I can't provide you with an exact timestamp for these, but I implemented them in the video. Please let me know if you're unsure whether they are in the video

Basic	Pinball	Dynamics*
I made the balls fall down in the top middle down the screen(accelerating under gravity).


Multiple	Balls	Interacting*
The 5 balls will eventually bounce off each other, it happens quick due to my setting off the line collision velocity whenever the balls hit on the lines.

Circular	Obstacles*
This will be the 5 spheres I implemented in which the balls will bounce off.

Line-Segment	and/or	Polygonal	Obstacles
The line segment will be on the bottom whenever the balls hit the surface, which will be the bricks below.

Textured	Background+
Decided to import a mario background, and was planning to use coins or the brick of blocks as spheres but it took much time figuring out, so I skipped out on it.
I do know we were working on a pinball machine game, but the layout was just too perfect to not go with a mario background.

Sound	Effects
The same as score display as whenever the balls hit the sphere, it will make a sound.

Score	Display
The score display is on the top showcasing the collision detection whenever the number of balls hit the spheres. 

3D	Rendering &	Camera
I used peasy as an resource to try and do a 3D camera, but lets just it did not turn out that great.
##### Difficulties
The difficulties were definitely matching up the image on spheres as I just gave up because it took too much time. Another really aspect was getting the 3D camera down as it did not look
good at all. I had to comment out some of my collision library as  it would just make duplicate errors and I just decided to just keep it in there because why not.
