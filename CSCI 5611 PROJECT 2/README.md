Please let me know if you did not see any of the implementations listed.

# Implementations
Multiple	Ropes (at	least	2D)*

Used a 3 X 20, but used no arrays(should use next time because my code is messy). Link the lines between each rope as well getting the constrain between each node from left to right.

Cloth	Simulation

Went to office hours, Professor Guy said I did not need a bounce in my collision since I was working with constrain and not the damped spring. Just implemented the same line of code from project 1 to see if the rope did collide with the sphere and it did.

# Tools Used
Vector Library (Stephen J. Guy <sjguy@umn.edu>)

# Difficulties
Going to be completely honest, I struggled with this project. I was working with some code then later scraped it up and followed the project with HW2. I just had a hard time going through it. Went upon office hours to get help on working on the collision and I really do appreciate the help Professor Guy. Put upon probably too much hours with just only getting this. I know it can easily be better than this. Just want to be stress free from this assignment and study for other classes.
